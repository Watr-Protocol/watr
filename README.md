# Watr
Watr Protocol is Watrâ€™s decentralized and public blockchain platform that is open to everyone who wants to build, create and collaborate on it. Watr gives developers, entrepreneurs and investors direct access to commodities as a platform.
It is a Polkadot Parachain, leveraging the shared security of the Polkadot ecosystem as well as high transaction throughput, connectivity with the other parachains and regular upgrades.

## Building & Running Locally

- Before starting, please follow the Substrate quick start guide to setup the environment. https://docs.substrate.io/quick-start/
- Also, install zombienet: https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet

1. Clone and build the Watr node
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/Watr-Protocol/watr.git
	cd watr

	# Build. Be patient, it can take a long time :)
	cargo build --release
	```

2. Build Polkadot 
	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git
	cd polkadot

	# Build with fast-runtime enabled
	cargo build --release --features fast-runtime
	``` 

3. Copy the `polkadot` binary stored at `target/release/polkadot` into the `watr/bin` directory.

	```shell
	# In polkadot root. Assuming watr is one directory up.
	cp target/release/polkadot ../watr/bin
	```

4. Start the local testnet

	To start Mainnet:
	```shell
	zombienet -p native spawn zombienet-config/mainnet.toml
	```

	To start Devnet:
	```shell
	zombienet -p native spawn zombienet-config/devnet.toml
	```

## Run Tests
```shell
cargo test
```

## Runtime Details
**Substrate**
- `pallet-scheduler` allows extrinsic calls to be scheduled for a later time
- `pallet-balances` maintains the native Watr currency
- `pallet-sudo` provides a single Root-privileged account. Will be removed
- `pallet-multisig` allows for several accounts to manage a single multisig account
- `pallet-identity` is a simple, federated, identity system that allows users to add a nickname, social medias, and more
- `pallet-collective` creates the Council
- `pallet-motion` provides root-level origin for the Council
- `pallet-membership` makes managing Council members easier
- `pallet-treasury` provides a pot for holding Council governed funds
- `pallet-assets` creates and manages new tokens
- `pallet-utility` provides dispatch management (such as batched calls)

**EVM / Frontier**
- `pallet-ethereum` provides Ethereum compatibilty and RPCs
- `pallet-evm` Adds an Ethereum Virtual Machine. Provides support for EVM contracts
- `pallet-base-fee` follows EIP-1559's fee mechanism
- `pallet-evm-precompile-assets-erc20` (aka XC-20s) allows EVM smart contracts to access `pallet-assets` using an ERC-20 interface
  
**XCM**
- `cumulus-pallet-xcmp-queue`
- `pallet-xcm`
- `cumulus-pallet-xcm`
- `cumulus-pallet-dmp-queue`
- XCM is configured to allow certain asset transfers to and from Statemint (e.g., USDt)

## Devnet
A current Devnet is running on the Rococo relay chain.

## Cumulus
This project was originally forked from the Substrate Parachain Template.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
for each release of Polkadot. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Parachain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-template-generator/).

parathreads [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads).


ðŸ§™ Learn about how to use this template and run your own parachain testnet for it in the
[Devhub Cumulus Tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/v3/cumulus/start-relay/).
